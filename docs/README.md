# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation! This README serves as the central entry point for understanding how OctoAcme runs projects and navigating our process documentation.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that ensures successful delivery of product features, services, and integrations. Our processes are designed to balance flexibility with consistency, enabling teams to deliver value efficiently while maintaining quality and transparency.

### Core Principles

Our project management approach is built on these foundational principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to gather feedback and adapt quickly
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead with defined responsibilities
- **Strong communication**: Maintain transparent, regular communication with stakeholders and team members
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

### Project Lifecycle Phases

OctoAcme projects follow a five-phase lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: Validate the business need, align stakeholders, define success criteria, and create a project one-pager
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks, and create a release plan
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate with daily standups and weekly delivery syncs
4. **Release**: Deploy features to production with proper testing, monitoring, and rollback plans
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Conduct retrospectives to capture learnings and implement actionable improvements
