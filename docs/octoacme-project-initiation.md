# OctoAcme — Project Initiation Guide

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome
- Identify stakeholders & champions
- Define success criteria and initial timeline
- Decide go/no-go for planning

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Stakeholder list & communication plan
- High-level timeline and key milestones
- Initial risk list
- Resource needs (team roles, rough effort estimate)
  - Consider needs for [Developers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#developers), [QA/Test Automation Engineers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#qatest-automation-engineer), [UX/UI Designers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#uxui-designer), [Technical Writers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#technical-writer), [Security Engineers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#security-engineer), etc.
