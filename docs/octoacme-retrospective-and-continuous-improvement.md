# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Include all relevant roles: [Developers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#developers), [QA/Test Automation Engineers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#qatest-automation-engineer), [Product Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#product-managers), [Project Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#project-managers), and others who contributed
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Consider inviting [UX/UI Designer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#uxui-designer), [Technical Writer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#technical-writer), [Release Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#release-manager), or [Security Engineer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#security-engineer) when their work was central to the sprint

## Tracking Improvements
