# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
- **[Project Manager (PM)](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#project-managers)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications
- **[Product Manager (PdM)](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#product-managers)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **[Developers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#developers)**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **[QA/Test Automation Engineer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#qatest-automation-engineer)**: Validates quality, automates testing, and ensures acceptance criteria are met
- **[UX/UI Designer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#uxui-designer)**: Conducts user research and designs intuitive interfaces (when applicable)
- **[Technical Writer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#technical-writer)**: Creates and maintains documentation for users and developers
- **[Release Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#release-manager)**: Oversees release process, coordinates deployments, and manages release communication
- **[Business Analyst](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#business-analyst)**: Bridges business and technical teams, elicits requirements
- **[Security Engineer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#security-engineer)**: Ensures security best practices throughout the project lifecycle
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, requirements, and approvals

See the [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) document for detailed responsibilities and interactions.

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
3. Execution: build, test, review, iterate.
4. Release: deploy, verify, announce.
5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context.
