# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
   - Include [Product Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#product-managers), [Project Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#project-managers), [Developers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#developers), and [Business Analyst](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#business-analyst) (as needed)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
   - [Business Analyst](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#business-analyst) documents requirements and user stories
   - [Product Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#product-managers) prioritizes based on business value
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
   - Include criteria from [QA/Test Automation Engineer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#qatest-automation-engineer), [Security Engineer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#security-engineer), and [Technical Writer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#technical-writer)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
   - [Release Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#release-manager) defines release schedule and deployment strategy
